## Introduction

Khallas checks the functions that aren't yet implemented.  

## Requirements
Python files that have functions either implemented or not implemented.  

## Usage
- Set the directory for searching for .py files in settings.py.
- Run """python khallas_cli.py"""

## Contribution
- Contributing is more than welcomed.
- Due to the fact that I'm thinking about releasing the product to public domain, so it's more free than it is now. By contributing, one agrees that the right to decide the license is only granted for me (Walid Shouman).
